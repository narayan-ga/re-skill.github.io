            "answer": "Motivating a disengaged team requires identifying the root cause of the disengagement. I start by conducting individual check-ins to listen to their concerns, whether it's burnout, lack of clear goals, or feeling undervalued...\n\nOnce I understand the issues, I focus on re-establishing a clear vision and purpose for the program, connecting their individual contributions to the larger impact. I also look for opportunities to empower them with autonomy, provide challenging but achievable tasks, and celebrate small wins...\n\nFor instance, in one program, disengagement stemmed from a lack of recognition. I implemented a 'team spotlight' initiative, which significantly boosted morale and productivity. It's about building psychological safety and trust within the team."
